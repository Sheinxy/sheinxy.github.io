# Introduction

Hello there!

My name is Sheinxy, and as I once was described like: I am epic programmer, I make
computer Bee Boop Beeep Boop Boop.

On this page, you may find a few things about what I do, things that I want
to share and stuff like that.

# Advent Of Code

Every year since 2020, I have partaken in the Advent Of Code.

I usually write my solutions in Haskell, and you can find write-ups
for them [here](https://sheinxy.github.io/Advent-Of-Code).

Most of the code can be found on my [github repository](https://github.com/Sheinxy/Advent-Of-Code)

# SHNES

Also known as "Sheinxy's Haskell NES", a small project/challenge that I am currently working on,
which is to make an emulator for the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System)
in Haskell.

# [Blog](./blog)

I believe that the best thing about having projects is learning from them.

I believe that the next best thing about having projects is sharing what I've learned from them.

This is why I may sometimes write blog-posts on a bunch of different topics.
