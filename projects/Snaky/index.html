                    Snaky is a small Discord bot that I code on my spare time. 
                    This bot is aimed at allowing users to create themselves custom commands, 
                    especially emotes, as well as some other few things.
                    <br/>
                    Snaky was created in november 2017 as a bot for my friends' discord server. 
                    At first, it didn't have much success, but with some time and new commands, 
                    it started getting some use.
